# Predicting-and-Forecasting-A-Global-Stock-Index-LSTM-vs-NARX

Predicting the S&P 500 index using LSTM and NARX. A comparison of the two models have been done to see which one is better suited to predict the index. The different prices (opening, closing, high etc.) were used to predict the prices. Project was done in MATLAB. 

<b> Future Work </b>

Use models to predict other stock indices. Include other factors to try and produce more accurate predictions.
